Anuko Auction Server

The goal of this project is to design a simple distributed auction network.

We see such network consisting of the following components:

1) Auction server.
2) Hub.


STANDALONE AUCTION SERVER

In a standalone mode Auction Server self-contains an isolated auction site.
Standalone mode means the server is not connected to any hubs.


NETWORKED AUCTION SERVER

In a networked mode (when installed with a hub) the server is connected to other participating servers.
It increases server exposure to users from other sites.


HUB

A hub is a separate project, see anuko/hub. It can be used to connect multiple server types together.


AUCTION COMPLETION WORKFLOW

In a standalone mode everything is done by one server as all users are local to it.

In a networked mode users are at different locations. For example, seller is at server A and bidder is at server B.

We'll design a networked system in a way so that each user only deals with its local server.

Therefore, in our example server A will communicate to the seller, and server B to the bidder.

This will hopefully reduce localization and workflow (versioning) issues that may arise when a foreign server
communicates to a local user.
